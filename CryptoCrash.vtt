00:00.000 --> 00:02.960
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Plain Bagel. I'm your host, Richard Coffin.

00:02.960 --> 00:06.240
We're back with another unscripted, more casual video.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.320
That's likely to be a bit all over the place.

00:08.320 --> 00:11.840
And generally, I tend to focus my content on the stock market because that's where I work.

00:11.840 --> 00:14.640
It's where I have my professional experience and whatnot.

00:14.640 --> 00:20.560
But it's hard to ignore the carnage going on with our neighbor next door,

00:20.560 --> 00:22.000
the cryptocurrency market.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.200
I mean, I've seen the Bitcoin, the sort of poster child of the area, has fallen back

00:25.200 --> 00:29.840
down to the $20,000 level, down roughly 70% from its all-time high.

00:29.840 --> 00:32.640
Either is down roughly 77% from its all-time high.

00:32.640 --> 00:37.040
We've seen certain stable coins lose their peg, meaning that these coins that were supposed to

00:37.040 --> 00:41.120
trade at one U.S. dollar has deviated from that amount, including Terry U.S. D.,

00:41.120 --> 00:44.000
which has completely collapsed and is now trading under a penny.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.120
Luna, the cryptocurrency tied to Terry U.S. D, as well as some very high yielding protocols,

00:49.120 --> 00:51.680
has itself collapsed in lost billions of dollars.

00:51.680 --> 00:54.320
Crypto companies are starting to have troubles with Crypto.com,

00:54.320 --> 00:58.480
the firm that famously hired Matt Damon to tell us that fortune favors are brave,

00:58.480 --> 01:03.120
equating buying cryptocurrency to be nasternaught, while they bravely start to lay off

01:03.120 --> 01:07.360
employees and have reneged on their promises to their investors regarding cashback rates.

01:07.360 --> 01:12.000
Coinbase, the publicly traded crypto exchange, has itself fallen quite drastically and is also

01:12.000 --> 01:17.200
laying off roughly 18% of its employee headcount, and then there's the more recent news around

01:17.200 --> 01:23.280
Celsius. A definitely not a bank that took deposits from some investors and lent them out to others,

01:23.520 --> 01:28.960
and offered very high yields ranging from 9% to 18% which has now frozen assets and locked up

01:28.960 --> 01:33.600
withdrawals, preventing people from accessing billions of dollars worth of their money that they

01:33.600 --> 01:38.640
have with their system, if you will. Now, any long-term viewer probably knows that I'm not the

01:38.640 --> 01:43.920
the biggest crypto enthusiast out there. I've made my thoughts known, I've shared my two cents before,

01:43.920 --> 01:49.920
but the intent of this video is truly not to dog pile in cryptocurrencies now that it's down.

01:49.920 --> 01:55.840
You know, that's not productive. And lo and behold, I don't like seeing people lose their money.

01:56.400 --> 02:00.560
You know, I know that there are obviously annoying crypto bros out there who will come in things

02:00.560 --> 02:05.600
like have fun staying poor, and you know, they're probably not gain all that many tears with the

02:05.600 --> 02:11.840
current downturn, but I know for every one of those, there are hundreds of not thousands of other

02:11.840 --> 02:15.600
investors who are just trying to meet their financial objectives. Well, the reason I want to make

02:15.680 --> 02:20.880
this video is because people, when it comes to giving advice about crypto, haven't learned

02:20.880 --> 02:26.000
their lesson, we're still seeing people say, you know, buy the dip, Bitcoin's at $20,000.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.800
This is the chance of a lifetime to make it big, to be the next 18-year-old Bitcoin billionaire

02:30.800 --> 02:35.600
living in a $2 million flat in San Francisco. I'm still seeing posts of people who said we

02:35.600 --> 02:40.800
would be at $100,000 by now, telling people to go all in to put as much money as they could,

02:40.880 --> 02:47.680
as well as clips like this one. But take all your money by Bitcoin, then take all your time,

02:47.680 --> 02:51.680
figure out how to borrow more money to buy more Bitcoin, then take all your time and figure out

02:51.680 --> 02:57.680
what you can sell to buy Bitcoin. And if you absolutely love the thing that you don't want to sell

02:57.680 --> 03:02.800
it, go mortgage your house and buy Bitcoin with it. And if you've got a business that you love

03:02.800 --> 03:07.840
because your family works for the businesses and your family for 37 years, and you can't bear

03:07.840 --> 03:14.880
to sell it, mortgage it, finance it, and convert the proceeds into the hardest money on earth,

03:14.880 --> 03:19.440
which is Bitcoin. That was Michael Saler, the CEO of MicroStrategy, and it's a clip I saw

03:19.440 --> 03:25.200
shared by Nate Anderson of Hindenburg Research. And while I'm sure this was Hashtag, not financial

03:25.200 --> 03:32.240
advice, it's obviously very damaging and very reckless if you will. And to be up front, this is

03:32.240 --> 03:38.560
actually an older clip. This was from when Bitcoin was around $56,000, but that actually makes it worse

03:38.560 --> 03:43.040
when you really think about it. And so with a lot of people still willing to push not financial advice,

03:43.040 --> 03:47.120
financial advice about cryptocurrencies, despite having no qualifications on that front,

03:47.120 --> 03:53.760
I figured it was time for another party. It's been a while. So we quickly going over why

03:53.760 --> 03:58.560
cryptocurrencies have fallen so much and why they're at this depressed level. And then going and

03:58.560 --> 04:02.160
tackling some of the arguments I've seen that are starting to circulate about cryptocurrencies

04:02.240 --> 04:06.000
and what people should do with their money. I think have a lot of holes with them that I think you should

04:06.000 --> 04:11.200
consider the arguments against these points before you make any decision when it comes to cryptocurrencies.

04:11.200 --> 04:15.280
Let's start with how we got here and why it seems like every platform and cryptocurrency seems

04:15.280 --> 04:19.920
to be falling apart around the same time. With the first point really being that when it comes to

04:19.920 --> 04:25.520
at least yielding platforms or whether it be lending or staking, a lot of these high yields,

04:25.520 --> 04:31.360
that would offer upwards of 10% returns for just depositing money into a system,

04:32.480 --> 04:36.000
they were always unsustainable. Now, some cryptocurrencies and platforms are fully aware

04:36.000 --> 04:41.120
that they couldn't sustain something like a 10 to 18% yield over long term. And in many cases,

04:41.120 --> 04:45.520
it was done just as a promotional rate, if you will. But the problem is that many investors kind of

04:45.520 --> 04:50.960
saw this as being a risk-free and stable source of return that they could just deposit money into

04:50.960 --> 04:56.160
and that would regularly pay them this high-high yield. Which, you know, obviously at 18%

04:56.160 --> 05:01.200
you're performing the stock market, you're performing many asset classes all by simply depositing

05:01.200 --> 05:06.800
money into an account, it was clearly unsustainable and not something that should be relied upon

05:06.800 --> 05:11.760
that was clearly taking risk in some form to earn that high return. And the reason for that is just

05:11.760 --> 05:16.880
the massive discrepancy between these very high yields and the regular yields within traditional

05:16.880 --> 05:20.400
finance. There are certainly going to be people willing to pay 18% for a loan, you know,

05:20.400 --> 05:24.240
people who might not have access to lines of credit or even credit cards or whatever,

05:24.240 --> 05:29.360
who might pay that higher rate. The vast majority of people probably have access to cheaper

05:29.600 --> 05:35.280
forms of financing. And so you have this limited pool of people willing to pay that rate and

05:35.280 --> 05:40.480
arguably a very large pool and growing pool of people willing to earn that rate. So when you have

05:40.480 --> 05:45.680
this, you know, limited demand for these very high interest rate loans or high yielding loans

05:45.680 --> 05:49.920
and you have all this supply, market factors will lead that yield to falling, right? You have

05:49.920 --> 05:55.120
all this supply, all these people demanding 18% but only so much of that 18% actually coming in,

05:55.120 --> 05:58.800
it's going to lead to a lower yield that these people over here can actually earn.

05:58.880 --> 06:03.360
Someone has to be paying that 18%. It doesn't matter whether it's an explicit borrower

06:03.360 --> 06:08.800
who's paying 18% interest on the loan or if it's the investors, you know, whether it be

06:08.800 --> 06:13.600
money taken from the pool of initial investors to pay these high rates to attract more people

06:13.600 --> 06:18.400
for that promotion or whatever or if it's taken from the value of the cryptocurrency because coins

06:18.400 --> 06:23.600
have to be printed, if you will, to pay people these excessively high rates of return. Eventually

06:23.600 --> 06:28.480
that will hurt the value of these cryptocurrencies, right? If you have to create more coins to

06:28.480 --> 06:33.520
pay this excessively high rate, well, you know, a lot of people criticize via currency for that kind

06:33.520 --> 06:38.240
of inflation, it impacts cryptocurrencies as well. Now outside the world of yield farming or whatever

06:38.240 --> 06:42.560
have you, there's also been these macroeconomic factors that have been applying downwards pressure

06:42.560 --> 06:47.280
on cryptocurrency valuations, right? We've covered it in past videos, including the recent

06:47.280 --> 06:51.520
stock market crash video, but one of the core things that's been influencing cryptocurrency prices

06:51.520 --> 06:55.200
is rising interest rates. Just this week, we had the Federal Reserve hike its own interest rate

06:55.280 --> 07:01.680
by 75 basis points as highest jump since 1994. And rising interest rates not only reduce economic

07:01.680 --> 07:06.640
activity, they make debt more expensive, thereby discouraging lending activity, and which can

07:06.640 --> 07:11.200
discourage economic activity as, you know, people face higher expenses and might not be willing to spend

07:11.200 --> 07:18.400
as much. It also can lead to a depressing evaluations of different investment classes, including stocks

07:18.400 --> 07:21.920
and yes, cryptocurrencies. Not to mention that, you know, a lot of people were highlighting how

07:22.000 --> 07:26.480
money supply skyrocketed during the pandemic, which, you know, it did, but you might not know this,

07:27.280 --> 07:33.840
money supply can fall, too. It can contract. And in fact, it has been contracting as interest rates rise,

07:33.840 --> 07:38.880
money supply can fall. Not to say it doesn't matter, not to say money supply still isn't really high,

07:38.880 --> 07:43.520
it's just, you know, I don't think a lot of people knew that money supply could come back down.

07:43.520 --> 07:47.840
And finally, you know, outside of those two things, they're the more idiosyncratic risks, you know,

07:47.840 --> 07:51.840
like fraud, where there have been situations where because it's unregulated because there's

07:51.840 --> 07:56.960
not a whole lot of oversight, there are platforms and there are cryptocurrency, you know, systems,

07:56.960 --> 08:02.960
where money has been misappropriated or, you know, used incorrectly. And investor promises haven't

08:02.960 --> 08:07.680
been met. And so when you combine these factors of, you know, unsustainable practices, economic pressures,

08:07.680 --> 08:13.440
and, you know, instances of fraud, it's led to this growing investor uncertainty and pessimism in the space,

08:13.440 --> 08:18.320
even around cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which itself isn't at the center of some of these factors.

08:18.400 --> 08:22.080
Obviously, it's not just cryptocurrencies that are down right now, right? Some of these factors are

08:22.080 --> 08:26.960
macroeconomic, they're affecting the whole of, of pretty much all asset classes that are out there.

08:26.960 --> 08:32.720
Stocks are down quite a bit, the S&B 500 recently entered bear market territory, falling over 20%

08:32.720 --> 08:37.360
from its recent high. So it's not just cryptocurrencies. Because everything is down, a lot of people are

08:37.360 --> 08:41.760
saying that look, this is just a downturn, things will recover over the long term, we've seen it with

08:41.760 --> 08:45.120
the stock market. And obviously, there is a chance a cryptocurrencies do recover and that they,

08:45.200 --> 08:51.040
they go back to their previous highs and, you know, surpass it. But cryptocurrencies are not stocks.

08:52.080 --> 08:58.240
I know, it's obvious when you say it out loud. But it's true. And you can't apply the same strategies

08:58.240 --> 09:03.120
inherently in trust that they'll work from stock market investing to cryptocurrency investing.

09:03.120 --> 09:06.640
It's not to say that there aren't similarities there. Obviously, when it comes to emotion management

09:06.640 --> 09:09.840
and all that stuff, of course, you know, that applies to all investment classes.

09:10.640 --> 09:15.920
But cryptocurrencies are not stocks. Stocks give you a stake in a profit generating business.

09:16.720 --> 09:21.520
Hopefully, if you did your research. And that profit generation gives that stock a sort of intrinsic

09:21.520 --> 09:26.320
value that it will or should normalize to over the long term, right? If you have this company that's

09:26.320 --> 09:31.440
generating $100 million a year in profit, but its price falls to a very depressed level. Well,

09:31.440 --> 09:36.800
over time, if that company keeps producing $100 million a year, its price will, you know, normalize

09:36.880 --> 09:40.720
to reflect that because otherwise, these investors are just making a killing buying at this very

09:40.720 --> 09:45.680
little rate and earning this very high profit generation from this company. Cryptocurrencies don't have

09:45.680 --> 09:50.480
that. They don't have that intrinsic profit generating based, you know, level if you will floor to their

09:50.480 --> 09:55.760
value, that over the long term, it can normalize to. Some people argue that it does have some sort of

09:55.760 --> 10:01.600
intrinsic value tied to its utility. But on that front, that's a lot harder to quantify. And it

10:01.600 --> 10:06.880
hasn't necessarily proven itself on that front. We've actually had perfect use case examples pop up

10:06.880 --> 10:11.840
for cryptocurrency adoption. We've had Russian sanctions. We've had Afghanistan where people have

10:11.840 --> 10:16.880
tried to adopt cryptocurrencies to circumvent the Taliban. We've had El Salvador, which adopted

10:16.880 --> 10:23.520
Bitcoin as its national currency. It shouldn't have because it's down quite a bit, but it did. And

10:23.520 --> 10:28.000
the problem is these adoptions on the one hand ran into problems and some circumstances,

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
such as with assets still being able to be frozen when they were used on exchanges. Even though,

10:32.000 --> 10:38.080
you know, to be fair true cryptocurrency use can't really be frozen, but a lot of its utilization

10:38.080 --> 10:44.000
in the defy networks can. And they haven't led to that skyrocketing value of these cryptocurrencies,

10:44.000 --> 10:48.720
because even though they have been adopted, the price of these assets had already been speculated

10:48.720 --> 10:53.600
up to a very high level. So yes, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies might have value based on their utility,

10:53.680 --> 10:58.640
but that utility is very easy to replicate as we've seen with the very many number of cryptocurrencies

10:58.640 --> 11:02.560
out there. There's this massive substitute in the form of traditional finance that offers many

11:02.560 --> 11:06.800
different alternatives. There's a very high learning curve in adoption curve for developing

11:06.800 --> 11:12.400
countries that might not even be able to get past the initial adoption phase. And there's a fact that

11:12.400 --> 11:17.840
the vast majority of people who own a lot of these cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, don't own it

11:17.920 --> 11:24.000
for that utility, appear to peer money transfers, which was the white paper indicated purpose

11:24.000 --> 11:28.400
of Bitcoin. Most people hold it as an investment on the hopes that other people will use it for

11:28.400 --> 11:33.600
that utility and that will increase the value of the Bitcoin you hold without you yourself using it

11:33.600 --> 11:37.760
for that purpose. And if you view the utility of these cryptocurrencies as being a store of value,

11:38.640 --> 11:42.080
obviously it hasn't done a very good job there as well. You know, if I told you that the

11:42.160 --> 11:46.320
US dollar was a store of value, but it fluctuated by 70 percentage points either way,

11:46.960 --> 11:51.680
you would probably say bullshit. Now another thing I've seen a lot of people share is the

11:51.680 --> 11:58.320
tenure price history of Bitcoin to show that the current dip is just a minor contraction on its way

11:58.320 --> 12:02.880
it's trajectory upwards, right? And it's not a bad idea to zoom out. You know, most investors

12:02.880 --> 12:08.240
would agree that as generally speaking a good practice. But 10 years is not really long enough

12:08.240 --> 12:12.400
to determine these sorts of trajectories. You know, if you were to take a 10-year period of

12:12.400 --> 12:18.080
stocks during 1973 to 1983, you would probably come to the conclusion that stocks are terrible

12:18.080 --> 12:22.400
investment because they didn't really do anything during that period of state inflation. And yet,

12:22.400 --> 12:27.120
you know, we know over the very long term that stocks on average return roughly 10% annually.

12:27.120 --> 12:31.040
Not to mention that when you consider the context of that 10-year period when Bitcoin was first

12:31.040 --> 12:36.800
created, it really does show how much of an influence the environment has been on its performance.

12:37.120 --> 12:43.280
Bitcoin has quite literally never existed outside of a very supportive monetary environment.

12:43.280 --> 12:47.840
When the first Bitcoin was created in 2009, it was not long after the federal fund's rate was cut

12:47.840 --> 12:52.800
to zero. And since then, it has only ever existed in the low interest rate environment.

12:52.800 --> 12:56.800
It's not a coincidence that Bitcoin started its rally to its all-time high

12:56.800 --> 13:01.440
within weeks of the federal government announcing its stimulus because of the pandemic.

13:01.440 --> 13:05.440
That's reached this all-time high during a period of unprecedented monetary support in the

13:05.440 --> 13:09.840
form of very low interest rates and quantitative easing. So when we take away these supports,

13:09.840 --> 13:13.760
there's obviously a risk there that Bitcoin won't go back to those levels that we're seeing when

13:13.760 --> 13:16.800
those supports were there. And that's something that a lot of people seem to ignore.

13:16.800 --> 13:20.400
That a lot of people don't mention when they tell you to take out a mortgage and put all your money

13:20.400 --> 13:25.760
into a Bitcoin, either because they don't know about it because they aren't actually an expert on these

13:25.760 --> 13:30.560
things or because they're just too blinded by the greed and by the belief that Bitcoin is the

13:30.560 --> 13:35.360
future and therefore it can only go up from here. Bitcoin might reach $60,000 and go past that

13:36.000 --> 13:40.560
but if you take anything from this video, it's to highlight that it's far from guaranteed.

13:40.560 --> 13:44.720
There are risks with Bitcoin with cryptocurrencies. It is not a stock. It is not a

13:44.720 --> 13:49.600
profit generating business. It is a speculative asset. Anyway, I'm done. I'll stop there before

13:49.600 --> 13:53.600
I go off the rails. If you want to buy cryptocurrency and you want to buy Bitcoin, all the power

13:53.600 --> 13:58.080
to you. The intent is not to discourage people. I just encourage you to A on the one side,

13:58.080 --> 14:02.960
manage your risk exposure. It is a risky asset no matter what people tell you. And most people

14:02.960 --> 14:08.240
don't have the risk tolerance to put their entire retirement savings into a cryptocurrency or into

14:08.240 --> 14:11.840
a set of cryptocurrencies. Just take everything here with a grain of salt. There's a lot of

14:11.840 --> 14:18.960
evangelists that told us that we'd be at 100,000 by now and we're not. Anyway, thank you for

14:18.960 --> 14:24.720
sitting through my rant today. I really do appreciate it. If you are pro cryptocurrencies in Bitcoin,

14:24.720 --> 14:29.120
I'm happy to hear your account arguments down below. The intent here is to have a conversation

14:29.200 --> 14:34.000
debate. To get us closer to the truth, it's not to try and prove people wrong. It's just

14:34.000 --> 14:38.160
to highlight the stuff that I think a lot of people are glazing over or misrepresenting when it

14:38.160 --> 14:43.120
comes to cryptocurrencies. So that you are more aware of the risks around it and so you can make

14:43.120 --> 14:47.840
a more informed and irrational decision. So thank you for joining me today. I hope you're doing

14:47.840 --> 14:53.440
well during these certainly uncertain times. And yeah, I'll always be safe out there.
